MENTOR NAME HERE

## Current Status
IN PROGRESS - PCB's and components have been ordered. A reflow oven and soldering station will be needed. 

## Project Overview
A sub6GHz RF Front End PCB for a spread spectrum comm system. 

Uses parts from mini circuits and mouser. 

4-layer PCB with amplifier and filter functionality

## Educational Value Added

Soldering (reflow and hand-soldering)
PCB Design
RF Front End Design
Amplifier Biasing

## Tasks
Use solder paste and reflow oven to solder components to the PCB

## Design Decisions

Cost effective parts
Size of parts
Hand vs. reflow soldering
Frequency Range


## Design Misc


## Steps for Documenting Your Design Process


## BOM + Component Cost

Everything has already been purchased by VTNSI 

## Timeline

As soon as possible. PCB's have already been shipped.
